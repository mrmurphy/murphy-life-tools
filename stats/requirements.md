# Stats Tracker Web App - EARS Requirements

## Epic

**As a user, I want to track daily statistics in a visual grid format so that I can monitor my habits and progress over time on any device.**

The Stats Tracker is a mobile-first web application that allows users to track daily statistics using a grid interface where rows represent trackers and columns represent days of the month. Users can toggle between three states (true, false, empty) for each tracker-day combination, customize trackers per month, and export/import their data.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Display a grid with trackers as rows and days of the current month as columns
- [ ] Each cell can toggle between three states: true (✓), false (✗), empty (blank)
- [ ] Tracker labels are pinned to the left side
- [ ] Day labels are shown at both top and bottom of the grid
- [ ] Current month is displayed by default on app load
- [ ] Users can navigate to different months
- [ ] Grid is scrollable both horizontally and vertically with sticky headers

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] App is responsive and optimized for mobile devices
- [ ] Touch interactions work smoothly for cell toggling
- [ ] Headers remain visible during scrolling
- [ ] Grid is easily navigable on small screens

### Tracker Management
- [ ] Users can add new trackers for any month
- [ ] Users can remove trackers from any month
- [ ] Trackers can be different between months
- [ ] When a tracker continues across months, it maintains the same ID
- [ ] Tracker names can be edited

### Data Persistence & Portability
- [ ] All data is stored locally using IndexedDB
- [ ] Users can export all data as a JSON file
- [ ] Users can import data from a JSON file
- [ ] Data persists across browser sessions
- [ ] No data is sent to external servers

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Built as a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA)
- [ ] Uses React for UI components
- [ ] Uses Chakra UI for styling and theming
- [ ] Uses Dexie.js for IndexedDB operations
- [ ] Can be hosted on any static file server
- [ ] Works offline after initial load

## Data Model

### Tracker Schema
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "name": "Tracker Name",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "months": ["2025-01", "2025-02"]
}
```

### Entry Schema
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "trackerId": "tracker-uuid",
  "date": "2025-01-15",
  "value": true | false | null,
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Export Format
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportedAt": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "trackers": [...],
  "entries": [...]
}
```
